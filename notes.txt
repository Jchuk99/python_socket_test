TODO:

1. IDK how to install fastestRPLidar, or if it even works, we might have to writes a SLAMTEC_SDK wrapper ourselves
	- ctypes, prior experience, will do exactly what we need it to do
	- SWIG, mid learning curve, works well if yoou want to support multiple languages
	- Boost Python?
	- Google CLIF?

2. I really want a DOCKER file set up for this project that recreates the raspberry pi environment, and that allows us to use anacond/pyenv to switch our python version
